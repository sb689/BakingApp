## Project Overview
This is a baking recipe application developed for the Android platform as part of an online course. Users can select a recipe and watch video-guided steps to complete it. This is a production-ready state app, which involves finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, adding a widget, exploring libraries.

## Requirements
- The app should display recipes from a provided network resource.
- The app should allow navigation between individual recipes and recipe steps.
- Uses RecyclerView and can handle recipe steps that include videos or images.
- Uses Master-Detail Flow to display recipe steps and navigation between them.
- Implements Exoplayer to display videos.
- Properly initializes and releases video assets when appropriate.
- Makes use of Espresso to test aspects of the UI.
- Has a companion home screen widget.
- The widget displays the ingredient list for the desired recipe.

## Why this Project?
As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app.

## Learning objectives
- Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
- Work with widget
- Leverage a third-party library in the app.
- Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
- Instrumented testing of android app
